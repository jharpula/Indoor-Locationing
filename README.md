# Indoor-Locationing
Problem: Given the WiFi strengths of 529 hotspots, can we predict where an individual is on a campus? Specifially, we want to know where (Floor, Room Number) in a building they
are located. 
Approach: Acquire, clean, vizualize, and pre-process data. Predict location (UniqueID) based on WiFi signal strength (explanatory variables). 
Final Results: LGBM best model at 80% accuracy
Files: Code (Jupyter Notebook) and Final Presentation (Power Point)
